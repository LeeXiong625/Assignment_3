    <h1>True Crime Stories</h1>
    <p>
      I've really been into watching true crime stories on Youtube lately
      because they are <strong>scary</strong> and <strong>shocking</strong>. Some
      of these stories are so <strong>bizarre</strong> that they don't even seem real but they 
      are, and that's the <strong>scariest</strong> part. One channel that I would reccomend is 
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ThatChapter">That Chapter</a>. The commentator picks cases
      from all over the world and he is very interesting to watch.
